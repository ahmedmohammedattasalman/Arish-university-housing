# Authentication System Fixes Changelog

## Fix Date: [Current Date]

### Issues Fixed:
1. Users were experiencing 404 errors when trying to access user data after login
2. Users were not being properly navigated to their dashboard after login
3. Authentication state was not being preserved properly during app restarts

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced UserProfile Retrieval in SupabaseService**
   - Added robust error handling for 404 errors in `getUserProfile` method
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms when user exists in Auth but not in Database
   - Added automatic user profile creation for authenticated users missing from database

2. **Added Local Storage Service**
   - Created `LocalStorageService` class to handle persistent storage of authentication state
   - Implemented methods to save, retrieve, and clear user profile data
   - Added methods to preserve authentication state between app sessions

3. **Updated AuthProvider**
   - Improved session handling with better error recovery
   - Added local caching of user data to prevent 404 errors
   - Implemented session refresh mechanisms to maintain authentication state
   - Enhanced error messaging for authentication failures

4. **Modified LoginScreen**
   - Improved login flow to ensure users are properly directed to dashboard
   - Added better feedback during login process
   - Ensured user role is properly set after authentication

5. **Updated Main.dart**
   - Added early initialization of SharedPreferences
   - Improved error handling during app startup

### Technical Details:

- The main issue was that the app was trying to fetch user data from a `users` table that either didn't exist or where the user record was missing
- Added fallback mechanisms to create user records automatically when they exist in Auth but not in the database
- Implemented local caching to reduce dependency on network requests for authentication state
- Enhanced error recovery to prevent automatic sign-out when user profile retrieval fails

### Testing:

- Verified login flow works correctly and users are directed to appropriate dashboards
- Tested app restart to ensure authentication state is preserved
- Validated error handling when network connectivity is limited
