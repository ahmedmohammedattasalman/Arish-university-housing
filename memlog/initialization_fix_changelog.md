# Initialization Fix Changelog

## Fix Date: [Current Date]

### Issues Fixed:
1. Flutter initialization errors with "scheduleFrameCallback must be initialized first"
2. "Trying to render a disposed EngineFlutterView" errors
3. Asset loading failures in web environment
4. Widget tree rebuild errors during authentication

### Changes Made:

1. **Improved App Initialization in main.dart**
   - Added a loading app state to show while services are initializing
   - Fixed initialization sequence to ensure proper Flutter bindings
   - Added delay between initializing Flutter and loading services
   - Removed redundant calls to `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`

2. **Enhanced SupabaseService**
   - Added proper debug configuration
   - Improved error handling during initialization
   - Added dispose method for proper cleanup of resources
   - Added better error logging for initialization issues

3. **Fixed CustomButton Widget**
   - Simplified the loading indicator implementation
   - Removed implementation that was causing initialization errors
   - Used safer CircularProgressIndicator.adaptive for cross-platform compatibility
   - Fixed styling references that may have been causing errors

4. **Updated AuthProvider Initialization**
   - Added post-frame callback for safer initialization
   - Added better error handling throughout the initialization process
   - Added guards to prevent multiple initializations
   - Improved error recovery for authentication state

5. **Enhanced Login Screen**
   - Added more widget mount state checks to prevent state updates on unmounted widgets
   - Improved error handling during login process
   - Reorganized code flow to prevent potential race conditions

### Technical Details:

- The main issue was that async operations were being performed during the initialization phase before the Flutter engine was fully ready.
- Fixed by ensuring we run an app first, then initialize services in the background.
- Added better error handling throughout the initialization process.
- Used post-frame callbacks to ensure widget tree is ready before doing operations.
- Fixed circular progress indicator implementations that were causing initialization issues.

### Testing:

- Verified app launches correctly without initialization errors
- Tested the login flow to ensure authentication works properly
- Confirmed navigation to dashboard works after login
- Checked for proper error handling when services fail to initialize
