# Arabic Language Support Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to support Arabic text in the University Housing app, particularly focusing on database operations with Supabase.

## Database Changes

1. **UTF-8 Collation**:
   - Updated text columns in profiles table to use `en_US.utf8` collation
   - This ensures proper storage and comparison of Arabic characters

2. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Updates**:
   - Simplified and fixed RLS policies for the profiles table
   - Ensured authenticated users can update their own profiles
   - Added service role access for initial profile creation

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - Created `is_arabic` function to detect Arabic text
   - Implemented a database function for Arabic text searches
   - Created a view for vacation requests with user information

## App Changes

1. **SupabaseService Enhancements**:
   - Updated `insertData` and `updateData` methods to handle Arabic text
   - Added error handling for RLS policy violations
   - Implemented `_processArabicData` to handle Arabic character detection
   - Added debugPrint logs to track Arabic text during operations

2. **Arabic Text Utils**:
   - Created `ArabicTextUtils` class with validation helpers
   - Added text direction detection for Arabic content
   - Implemented form validation specifically for Arabic text

3. **Arabic Text Widget**:
   - Created `ArabicTextField` widget that automatically handles RTL for Arabic
   - Properly styled text fields for Arabic input
   - Implemented text direction switching based on content

4. **Localization Improvements**:
   - Enhanced `AppLocalizations` with more Arabic translations
   - Added Arabic numeral formatter
   - Implemented text direction helper methods
   - Created `LanguageToggleButton` for easy language switching

5. **Testing Screen**:
   - Added `TestArabicScreen` to verify Arabic text storage and retrieval
   - Tests updating profile with Arabic name and text
   - Displays retrieved data with proper RTL formatting

## Registration/Profile Update Process

1. **User Registration**:
   - Fixed the signup process to properly handle Arabic names
   - Ensuring profile data is created with correct user_id and user_role
   - Added fallback profile update if creation fails due to RLS

2. **Profile Updates**:
   - Improved error handling for RLS violations
   - Added explicit user_id validation before updates
   - Properly processes Arabic text before sending to database

## How to Test

1. Use the Arabic test button in the student dashboard
2. Enter Arabic text in the test fields and submit
3. Verify that the retrieved data shows the Arabic text correctly
4. Check the database directly to confirm proper storage

## Known Limitations

1. The database must have proper UTF-8 support for the Arabic text to be stored correctly
2. Some older browsers may not display Arabic text properly
3. Text measurement for UI layouts may require adjustment for Arabic text which can be longer

## Future Improvements

1. Add Arabic text search functionality
2. Improve form validation messages in Arabic
3. Implement full RTL layout for all screens
4. Add more comprehensive Arabic content throughout the app
